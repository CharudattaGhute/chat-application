# Chat-application
This is a simple chat application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It allows users to send messages in real-time and incorporates a basic AI to respond to certain keywords.

## Technologies Used

## Frontend
- HTML: HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
- CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling HTML elements and defining the layout of web pages.
- JavaScript: A programming language that enables interactive and dynamic behavior on web pages. In this project, JavaScript is used for client-side scripting to handle user interactions and send/receive messages in real-time.
## Backend
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. Express simplifies the process of creating APIs and handling HTTP requests/responses.
- Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It facilitates real-time messaging between users in this chat application.
